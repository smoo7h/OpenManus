OBJECTIVE:
Create a well-structured, visually appealing research report documenting every possible method to obtain Mew in the original Pokémon Red/Blue games. Include both official methods and unofficial exploits/glitches.

   - Note required game version or hardware
   - Include probability of success and potential risks
   - Document prerequisites (game progress, items needed, etc.)

3. Find and include relevant screenshots/images to illustrate the methods

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Create multiple .md files organized in a logical structure
- Use clean Markdown formatting with headers, lists, code blocks where appropriate
