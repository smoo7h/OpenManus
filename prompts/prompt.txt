Manus, your task is to develop a web application that features a self-playing snake game. The game should run autonomously with AI controlling the snake's movement, and users should be able to watch the gameplay unfold. Below are the detailed requirements to guide your development process.

Requirements:
1. Game Interface
Design: Create an intuitive and engaging game UI that includes:
A canvas or grid area where the snake game is displayed.
A score counter showing the current length of the snake.
Responsiveness: Ensure the interface is fully responsive and functions seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
Optional Enhancements: Consider adding features like game speed controls, visual themes, or a high score display to enhance the user experience.

2. AI Implementation
Algorithm: Implement a pathfinding algorithm for the snake to navigate the board efficiently.
Strategy: Program the snake to avoid collisions with walls and itself while seeking food items.
Difficulty Progression: Make the AI gradually increase in complexity as the game progresses and the snake grows longer.
Visualization: Provide visual cues to indicate the AI's decision-making process (optional).

3. Game Mechanics
Basic Rules: Follow standard snake game rules where the snake grows when eating food.
Food Placement: Randomly spawn food items on the board in valid positions.
Collision Detection: Implement proper detection for wall and self-collisions.
Game Over Conditions: End the game when the snake collides with a wall or itself.

4. Technical Implementation
Frontend: Use vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS or choose a framework such as React or Vue.js to build the game.
Animation: Implement smooth animations for snake movement using requestAnimationFrame or similar techniques.
Game Loop: Create an efficient game loop that manages updates and rendering at appropriate intervals.
Autonomous Restart: After a game over, automatically restart the game after a brief pause.

5. User Experience
Initial State: When the user opens the app, display a brief introduction and automatically start the game:
"Welcome to Self-Playing Snake! Watch as the AI navigates through the game."
Visual Feedback: Ensure clear visual feedback when the snake eats food, grows, or when game over occurs.

6. Additional Notes
Performance: Optimize the game to run smoothly without lag, even as the snake grows longer.
Focus: Prioritize creating a hypnotic and fascinating AI behavior that's interesting to watch.
Customization: Consider allowing users to adjust parameters like game speed or board size.

By following these guidelines, you will create a webapp that offers users a captivating and entertaining self-playing snake game. The application should be functional, visually appealing, and showcase interesting AI behavior that makes the autonomous gameplay engaging to watch.
