Manus, your task is to develop a web application that features a self-playing Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game should run autonomously with AI controlling both 'X' and 'O' players, making optimal or near-optimal moves, and users should be able to watch the game play out. Below are the detailed requirements to guide your development process.

Requirements:
1. Game Interface
Design: Create a simple and clear game UI that includes:
A 3x3 grid representing the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
Visual indicators for 'X' and 'O' marks within the grid cells.
A display area indicating the current player's turn ('X' or 'O').
A status display showing the game outcome (X wins, O wins, Draw).
Responsiveness: Ensure the interface is clean and functional on both desktop and mobile devices.
Optional Enhancements: Consider adding features like highlighting the winning line, keeping track of win/loss/draw statistics over multiple games, or allowing the user to play against the AI.

2. AI Implementation
Algorithm: Implement an algorithm for the AI players to determine the best move. The Minimax algorithm (or a simplified version) is ideal for Tic-Tac-Toe, as it can guarantee optimal play.
Strategy: Program the AI to:
Prioritize winning moves (if available).
Block the opponent's winning moves (if necessary).
Choose strategically advantageous positions (center, corners).
Play optimally to force a win or a draw if possible.
Turn-Based Play: The AI should alternate turns between playing as 'X' and 'O'.
Visualization: Briefly highlight the cell the AI chooses for its move (optional).

3. Game Mechanics
Basic Rules: Follow standard Tic-Tac-Toe rules. Players take turns placing their mark ('X' or 'O') in an empty cell. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
Turn Management: Alternate turns between the 'X' AI and the 'O' AI.
Win Condition: Detect when a player achieves three marks in a row.
Draw Condition: Detect when all cells are filled, and no player has won.
Game State: Maintain the state of the 3x3 board accurately.
Autonomous Restart: After a game ends (win or draw), automatically restart a new game after a brief pause, potentially switching which AI ('X' or 'O') starts first.

4. Technical Implementation
Frontend: Use vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS or choose a framework such as React or Vue.js to build the game.
Rendering: Update the grid visually after each AI move.
Game Loop/Event Handling: Manage the turn-based flow of the game. Since it's turn-based, a traditional high-frequency game loop might not be necessary; event-driven updates after each AI move are suitable.
AI Logic Execution: Ensure the AI calculation (e.g., Minimax) runs efficiently for each turn.

5. User Experience
Initial State: When the user opens the app, display a brief introduction and automatically start the first game:
"Welcome to Self-Playing Tic-Tac-Toe! Watch the AI duel."
Visual Feedback: Ensure clear visual feedback for placing marks, winning lines, and game outcomes (win/draw).

6. Additional Notes
Performance: AI calculation for Tic-Tac-Toe is very fast, so performance should not be an issue.
Focus: Prioritize demonstrating optimal or near-optimal play by the AI, showcasing strategic decision-making.
Customization: Consider allowing users to adjust the AI's difficulty (e.g., optimal vs. random moves) or letting the user play against one AI.

By following these guidelines, you will create a webapp that offers users an interesting demonstration of AI in a self-playing Tic-Tac-Toe game. The application should clearly show the game's progression and the AI's moves.
