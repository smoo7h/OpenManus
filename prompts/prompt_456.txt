Manus, your task is to develop a web application that features a self-playing Breakout game. The game should run autonomously with AI controlling the paddle, and users should be able to watch the gameplay unfold as the AI tries to clear all the bricks. Below are the detailed requirements to guide your development process.

Requirements:
1. Game Interface
Design: Create a visually clear game UI that includes:
A rectangular play area.
A paddle at the bottom controlled by the AI.
A ball that bounces off the walls and paddle.
A grid of bricks at the top of the play area.
A score counter showing the number of bricks destroyed or points earned.
Responsiveness: Ensure the interface is fully responsive and functions seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
Optional Enhancements: Consider adding features like different brick types (multi-hit, power-ups), levels, or visual effects when bricks break.

2. AI Implementation
Algorithm: Implement an algorithm for the AI paddle to predict the ball's trajectory and position itself to intercept it.
Strategy: Program the AI paddle to move left or right to hit the ball towards the remaining bricks. The AI should prioritize keeping the ball in play.
Difficulty Progression: Optionally, increase the ball speed or introduce more complex brick layouts as the game progresses.
Visualization: Provide visual cues to indicate the AI's target interception point (optional).

3. Game Mechanics
Basic Rules: Follow standard Breakout rules. The ball bounces off the side and top walls, the paddle, and destroys bricks upon contact.
Brick Destruction: Remove bricks when hit by the ball and update the score.
Ball Physics: Implement realistic ball movement and bouncing angles, especially off the paddle and bricks.
Paddle Movement: Allow the AI paddle to move horizontally within the bounds of the play area.
Game Over Conditions: End the game when the ball goes past the paddle at the bottom.
Win Condition: The game is won when all bricks are cleared.
Autonomous Restart: After a game over or level clear, automatically restart the game or proceed to the next level after a brief pause.

4. Technical Implementation
Frontend: Use vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS or choose a framework such as React or Vue.js to build the game.
Animation: Implement smooth animations for ball and paddle movement using requestAnimationFrame or similar techniques.
Game Loop: Create an efficient game loop that manages updates (ball position, paddle position, collision detection with walls, paddle, and bricks) and rendering.
Level Management: If implementing levels, manage the loading and transition between different brick layouts.

5. User Experience
Initial State: When the user opens the app, display a brief introduction and automatically start the game:
"Welcome to Self-Playing Breakout! Watch the AI clear the bricks."
Visual Feedback: Ensure clear visual feedback when the ball hits the paddle, breaks a brick, or when game over occurs.

6. Additional Notes
Performance: Optimize the game to run smoothly, especially with many bricks and fast ball speeds.
Focus: Prioritize creating effective AI paddle control that demonstrates a reasonable strategy for clearing bricks.
Customization: Consider allowing users to adjust parameters like ball speed or select different starting levels.

By following these guidelines, you will create a webapp that offers users an entertaining self-playing Breakout game. The application should be functional, visually appealing, and showcase interesting AI behavior as it attempts to clear the screen.
