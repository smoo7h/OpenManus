# OpenManus System Patterns

## System Architecture

OpenManus follows a modular, layered architecture designed for flexibility and extensibility:

    Agent --> Tools[Tool Collection]

```

### Core Components

1. **Agent System**: The central orchestration layer that manages the execution flow, memory, and tool selection.
2. **Memory Management**: Stores conversation history, execution results, and context for decision-making.
3. **Tool Collection**: A registry of available tools that the agent can use to accomplish tasks.
4. **LLM Integration**: Connects to language models for reasoning, planning, and decision-making.
5. **Sandbox Environment**: Provides isolated execution for potentially risky operations.

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Agent Hierarchy

OpenManus implements a hierarchical agent structure:

- **BaseAgent**: Abstract foundation with core functionality (memory, state management, execution loop)
- **ToolCallAgent**: Extends BaseAgent with tool execution capabilities
- **BrowserAgent**: Extends ToolCallAgent with browser-specific functionality
- **Manus**: The main agent class that combines all capabilities

This hierarchy allows for specialized agent types while maintaining a consistent interface and shared functionality.

### 2. Tool Abstraction

Tools are implemented as standalone classes with a consistent interface, allowing for:
- Easy addition of new tools
- Consistent error handling
- Uniform integration with the agent system

### 3. Memory Model

The memory system uses a message-based approach, storing interactions as a sequence of messages with different roles (user, system, assistant, tool). This approach:
- Aligns with LLM conversation formats
- Provides clear context for decision-making
- Enables effective prompt construction

### 4. Sandbox Isolation

For security and stability, potentially risky operations (like Python code execution) can be isolated in a Docker container, providing:
- Protection against malicious code
- Resource limitations
- Clean execution environment

## Design Patterns in Use

### 1. Strategy Pattern

The agent system uses the Strategy pattern to select and execute different tools based on the current context and requirements.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class ToolCollection {
        +get_tool(name)
        +register_tool(tool)
    }

    class Tool {
        <<interface>>
        +name
        +description
        +execute()
    }

    Tool <|-- PythonExecute
    Tool <|-- BrowserUseTool
    Tool <|-- FileOperators

    ToolCollection o-- Tool
```

### 2. Observer Pattern

The agent implements an observer-like pattern for monitoring execution state and detecting issues like infinite loops or stuck states.

### 3. Factory Pattern

The system uses factory methods to create appropriate agent instances and tool collections based on configuration.

### 4. Context Manager Pattern

State transitions and resource management use context managers to ensure proper cleanup and state restoration.

### 5. Dependency Injection

Components like LLM clients and tool collections are injected into agents, promoting loose coupling and testability.

## Component Relationships

### Agent and Tools Interaction

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    User->>Main: Input request
    Main->>Agent: Process request
    Agent->>LLM: Generate plan
    LLM-->>Agent: Return plan
    loop For each step
        Agent->>ToolCollection: Select tool
        ToolCollection-->>Agent: Return tool
        Agent->>Tool: Execute with parameters
        Tool-->>Agent: Return result
        Agent->>Memory: Update with result
        Agent->>LLM: Decide next step
        LLM-->>Agent: Return decision
    end
    Agent-->>Main: Return final result
    Main-->>User: Display result
```

### Browser Automation Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Agent->>BrowserTool: Execute browser action
    BrowserTool->>Browser: Control browser
    Browser-->>BrowserTool: Return state/screenshot
    BrowserTool-->>Agent: Return result with image
    Agent->>LLM: Process with visual context
    LLM-->>Agent: Return next action
```

## Extension Points

OpenManus is designed with several key extension points:

1. **New Tools**: Add new capabilities by implementing the Tool interface
2. **Custom Agents**: Create specialized agents for specific domains
3. **Alternative LLMs**: Support different language models through the LLM abstraction
4. **Enhanced Sandboxing**: Customize the sandbox environment for different security requirements
5. **Additional Prompts**: Modify system and task-specific prompts for different behaviors

These extension points allow the system to evolve and adapt to new requirements without major architectural changes.
