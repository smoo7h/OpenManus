# OpenManus Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus for OpenManus is establishing a comprehensive Memory Bank to document the project's architecture, goals, and technical details. This documentation will serve as the foundation for future development and collaboration.

Key areas of focus include:

1. **Project Documentation**: Creating detailed documentation of the project's purpose, architecture, and technical implementation.

2. **Memory Bank Structure**: Establishing a well-organized structure for the Memory Bank to facilitate easy access to project information.

3. **Understanding Core Components**: Analyzing the agent system, tool collection, and execution flow to accurately document the system's behavior.

## Recent Changes

As this is the initial setup of the Memory Bank, there are no previous changes to document. The Memory Bank is being created based on the current state of the OpenManus project as observed in the repository.

Key files examined to understand the project include:

- `README.md`: Project overview and installation instructions
- `main.py`: Entry point for the application
- `app/agent/manus.py`: Implementation of the main Manus agent
- `app/agent/base.py`: Base agent implementation
- `app/agent/browser.py`: Browser agent implementation
- `app/prompt/manus.py`: System and task prompts for the Manus agent
- `config/config.example.toml`: Configuration template

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps for the project include:

1. **Complete Memory Bank Setup**:
   - Create the remaining core files (progress.md)
   - Review all documentation for consistency and completeness
   - Establish a .clinerules file to capture project-specific patterns

2. **Explore Implementation Details**:
   - Analyze tool implementations to better understand capabilities
   - Examine the sandbox implementation for security considerations
   - Review the flow system for multi-agent coordination

3. **Identify Improvement Opportunities**:
   - Look for areas where documentation can be enhanced
   - Identify potential enhancements to the agent system
   - Consider additional tools that could expand capabilities

4. **User Experience Evaluation**:
   - Test the installation and configuration process
   - Evaluate the command-line interface
   - Consider documentation improvements for new users

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Documentation Structure

The Memory Bank is being structured according to a hierarchical approach:
- `projectbrief.md`: Core project goals and scope
- `productContext.md`: Why the project exists and problems it solves
- `systemPatterns.md`: System architecture and design patterns
- `techContext.md`: Technologies used and technical details
- `activeContext.md`: Current focus and next steps
- `progress.md`: Current status and roadmap

This structure is designed to provide a comprehensive view of the project while maintaining clear separation of concerns.

### Technical Approach

Based on the codebase analysis, several key technical decisions are being documented:

1. **Agent Hierarchy**: The system uses a hierarchical approach to agent implementation, with specialized agents extending base functionality.

2. **Tool Abstraction**: Tools are implemented as standalone classes with a consistent interface, allowing for easy extension.

3. **Asynchronous Design**: The system uses asyncio for efficient handling of concurrent operations.

4. **Sandbox Isolation**: Potentially risky operations are isolated in Docker containers for security.

5. **LLM Flexibility**: The system supports multiple LLM providers through a consistent interface.

### Open Questions

Several questions remain to be explored:

1. **Multi-Agent Coordination**: How does the flow system coordinate multiple agents?

2. **Error Handling**: What mechanisms are in place for handling errors during execution?

3. **Testing Strategy**: What testing approaches are used to ensure reliability?

4. **Performance Optimization**: Are there specific optimizations for handling large contexts or complex tasks?

5. **Community Engagement**: What is the current state of community involvement and contribution?

These questions will be addressed as the Memory Bank is further developed and the project is explored in more depth.
