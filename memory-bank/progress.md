# OpenManus Progress

## Current Status

OpenManus is in active development with a functional core system. The project has established its foundational architecture and key components, with ongoing improvements and extensions being added by the community.

### Development Phase

The project is currently in the **Active Development** phase, having moved beyond the initial prototype stage. The core functionality is operational, and the focus is now on refinement, extension, and community engagement.

### Version Status

While no explicit version number is provided in the documentation, the project appears to be in an early but functional state, with active development ongoing.

## What Works

The following core capabilities are currently functional:

### 1. Agent System

- âœ… Base agent architecture with memory management and execution loop
- âœ… Tool-calling agent implementation
- âœ… Browser agent for web interaction
- âœ… Manus agent combining multiple capabilities

### 2. Tool Collection

- âœ… Python code execution
- âœ… Browser automation via Playwright
- âœ… File operations
- âœ… String replacement editor
- âœ… Terminal command execution
- âœ… Web search capabilities

### 3. Infrastructure

- âœ… Configuration system via TOML files
- âœ… Docker-based sandbox for secure execution
- âœ… Multiple LLM provider support
- âœ… Asynchronous execution model

### 4. User Interface

- âœ… Command-line interface for user interaction
- âœ… Basic logging and feedback mechanisms

### 5. Documentation

- âœ… Installation instructions
- âœ… Configuration guidance
- âœ… Basic usage examples

## What's Left to Build

Based on the repository analysis, several areas appear to be under development or planned for future implementation:

### 1. Enhanced Multi-Agent Capabilities

- ðŸ”„ Stable multi-agent workflows (currently marked as "unstable")
- ðŸ”„ Improved agent coordination and communication
- ðŸ”„ Specialized agent types for specific domains

### 2. Additional Tools

- ðŸ”„ More sophisticated file manipulation tools
- ðŸ”„ Enhanced web search capabilities
- ðŸ”„ Additional API integrations
- ðŸ”„ Domain-specific tools for common tasks

### 3. User Experience

- ðŸ”„ Web-based interface (if planned)
- ðŸ”„ Improved error handling and recovery
- ðŸ”„ Better visualization of agent reasoning
- ðŸ”„ More comprehensive examples and tutorials

### 4. Infrastructure

- ðŸ”„ Enhanced testing framework
- ðŸ”„ Performance optimizations
- ðŸ”„ Deployment streamlining
- ðŸ”„ Integration with additional LLM providers

### 5. Documentation

- ðŸ”„ API documentation
- ðŸ”„ Advanced usage guides
- ðŸ”„ Contribution guidelines
- ðŸ”„ Architecture documentation

## Known Issues

While specific issues are not explicitly documented in the repository, several potential challenges can be inferred:

### 1. Stability Concerns

- The multi-agent version is explicitly marked as "unstable" in the README
- Browser automation may have reliability issues depending on web page structure

### 2. Configuration Complexity

- Setting up API keys and configuration may be challenging for new users
- Multiple configuration options could lead to confusion

### 3. Performance Limitations

- LLM API latency affects overall responsiveness
- Large context windows may lead to token limit issues
- Docker sandbox adds overhead to execution

### 4. Security Considerations

- Python code execution carries inherent risks
- API keys stored in configuration files need proper protection
- Browser automation may have security implications

### 5. Compatibility

- Python 3.12 requirement may limit deployment options
- Docker dependency for sandbox functionality may be a barrier for some users

## Next Development Priorities

Based on the repository analysis and project status, the following priorities appear most important for continued development:

1. **Stabilize Multi-Agent System**: Improve the reliability and functionality of the flow-based multi-agent system

2. **Enhance Documentation**: Develop more comprehensive documentation, especially for contributors and advanced users

3. **Expand Example Collection**: Create more diverse and detailed examples to showcase capabilities

4. **Improve Error Handling**: Enhance the system's ability to recover from errors and provide useful feedback

5. **Optimize Performance**: Address performance bottlenecks, especially around LLM API usage and context management

## Community Engagement

The project appears to have an active community, with:

- A Discord server for communication
- GitHub stars indicating interest
- Contributions from multiple team members
- Open invitation for suggestions and contributions

Increasing community engagement and contributions will likely be a key factor in the project's continued development and success.
