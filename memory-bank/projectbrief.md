# OpenManus Project Brief

## Project Overview
OpenManus is an open-source framework for building general AI agents without requiring an invitation code. It aims to provide a versatile, accessible alternative to the commercial "Manus" product. The project was developed by a team from MetaGPT and launched rapidly (prototype in 3 hours).

## Core Objectives
- Create a fully functional, open-source alternative to Manus
- Enable users to build and deploy AI agents without invitation codes
- Provide a comprehensive set of tools for AI agent capabilities
- Maintain a simple, extensible architecture for community contributions

## Key Features
- **Multi-tool Agent System**: Combines Python execution, web browsing, file operations, and more
- **Browser Automation**: Enables web interaction through Puppeteer
- **Planning Capabilities**: Breaks down complex tasks into manageable steps
- **Extensible Architecture**: Designed for easy addition of new tools and capabilities
- **Docker Support**: Containerization for consistent deployment

## Target Users
- Developers seeking to build AI agents
- Researchers exploring agent-based AI systems
- Users who want Manus-like functionality without invitation requirements
- Contributors to open-source AI projects

## Success Criteria
- Functional parity with core Manus capabilities
- Easy installation and configuration process
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- Active community engagement and contributions
- Stable performance across different environments

## Project Constraints
- Requires API keys for LLM services (Claude, GPT-4, etc.)
- Python 3.12 environment
- Potential limitations based on underlying LLM capabilities

## Timeline
- Initial prototype: Completed
- Current phase: Active development and community engagement
- Future: Ongoing improvements, additional tools, and enhanced capabilities
