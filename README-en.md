# 🎉 iHeyTang OpenManus

Manus is amazing, but OpenManus can realize any creative idea without an invitation code 🛫!

(**Especially when it has an outstanding frontend interaction experience, it's simply fantastic!**)

## Project Vision

1. A versatile AI assistant for general domains, providing the strongest support for super individuals and one-person companies in the AI era
2. Rapid development and validation of specialized domain AI agents, offering the best efficiency platform for vertical AI Agents

## Project Demo

(Yes, it has full process replay capability, allowing you to share an execution process in an almost lossless way)

https://openmanus.iheytang.com/share/tasks/cm9k3hmiv00ezo8011k4008qx

## Project Features

1. Clean and elegant operation interface - Command line? Not here.
2. Multi-organization, multi-user support - This is great, each tenant can configure their own APIKey
3. Background task execution - Ask questions, close the page, come back later to see the results
4. Quick MCP integration - Fast installation from MCP marketplace, get started with MCP in 1 minute
5. Task-partitioned workspace - Each task's attachments can be browsed separately
6. Multi-turn conversations - Task not completed well? Keep asking questions

## Installation Guide

The project is divided into two parts: Core (root directory) and App (web/)

### OpenManus Core

1. Install uv (a fast Python package manager):

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iHeyTang/OpenManus.git
cd OpenManus
```

3. Create and activate virtual environment:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate  # Unix/macOS systems
# For Windows systems use:
# .venv\Scripts\activate

# After successful installation, you'll see the following prompt. You can either restart Terminal or follow these instructions:
#To add $HOME/.local/bin to your PATH, either restart your shell or run:
#    source $HOME/.local/bin/env (sh, bash, zsh)
#    source $HOME/.local/bin/env.fish (fish)

# Verify uv installation success
uv --version
# Output the following version number indicates successful installation
# uv 0.6.14 (a4cec56dc 2025-04-09)
```

4. Install dependencies:

````bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

### Install browser automation tool playwright
```bash
playwright install
````

5. Install Docker environment, recommended [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) for Windows, [Orbstack](https://orbstack.dev/download) for MacOS or Linux

### OpenManus App

1. Install `node` environment

   Method 1: [Recommended] Use nvm package manager https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
   Method 2: Download from official website https://nodejs.org/en
   Method 3: (Windows systems) Use nvm package manager https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases/tag/1.2.2

```bash
# After installation, verify success with command
node -v
# Output version number indicates successful installation
# v20.19.0
```

2. Enter `web/` folder

```bash
# Ignore if already in web directory
cd web
```

3. Install project dependencies

```bash
# Install project dependencies
npm install
```

4. Generate key pair

The project requires a public-private key pair for authentication, which can be generated with the following command (skip if you can generate certificates yourself):

```bash
npm run generate-keys

# This will generate in the `web/keys` directory:
# - `private.pem`: Private key file
# - `public.pem`: Public key file
```

5. Database initialization

The project uses PostgreSQL as the persistent database. You can use [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) to start the database service

```bash
# Start docker container and automatically create database named openmanus
docker run --name openmanus-db -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -e POSTGRES_DB=openmanus -d -p 5432:5432 postgres
```

6. Environment variable configuration

Create `.env` file in project root directory, configure necessary environment variables, refer to `/web/.env.example`

```bash
# If following step 5 database configuration, the database connection is
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/openmanus?schema=public"
```

7. Generate Prisma Client & Initialize Database

```bash
# If first time starting project, reinstalled dependencies, or schema.prisma has updates, execute this command to update Prisma Client
npx prisma generate

# If first time starting project, need to initialize database, this command will automatically sync table structure into configured database
npx prisma db push
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# OpenManus Core starts with run_api.py
python run_api.py
```

```bash
# OpenManus App needs to enter web/ directory, start with npm run dev
cd web
npm run dev
```

After starting, open `http://localhost:3000` to view
